The OPENVPN_CONFIG is an optional variable. If no config is given, a default config will be selected for the provider you have chosen. Find available OpenVPN configurations by looking in the openvpn folder of the GitHub repository. The value that you should use here is the filename of your chosen openvpn configuration without the .ovpn file extension. For example: 1 -e \"OPENVPN_CONFIG=USA - Austin-256\" You can also provide a comma separated list of openvpn configuration filenames. If you provide a list, a file will be randomly chosen in the list, this is useful for redundancy setups. For example: 1 -e \"OPENVPN_CONFIG=ipvanish-AT-Vienna-vie-c02,ipvanish-FR-Paris-par-a01,ipvanish-DE-Frankfurt-fra-a01\" If you provide a list and the selected server goes down, after the value of ping-timeout the container will be restarted and a server will be randomly chosen, note that the faulty server can be chosen again, if this should occur, the container will be restarted again until a working server is selected. To make sure this work in all cases, you should add --pull-filter ignore ping to your OPENVPN_OPTS variable.","title":"Run from Docker registry"},{"location":"supported-providers/","text":"This is a list of providers that are bundled within the image.
